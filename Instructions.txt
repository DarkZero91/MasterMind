In this game of Mastermind, you and your opponent try to crack each others' code, which are sequences of 4 colours.

How to play (code selection):
Choose your code by tapping on a dark circle and then tapping the colour you would like to select. When you want to change a colour, tap on a coloured circle and select the new colour.
After you selected a colour for all four circles, you may tap the "select code" button which will appear to start the game.

How to play (mastermind):
When the game starts, you can attempt to crack the code of your opponent.
To do this, tap on a black circle and then select a colour by tapping one of the coloured circles which will show up at the bottom of the screen. You can change a coloured circle by tapping on it and select a new colour.
After you selected a colour for all four circles, you may tap the "confirm" button to confirm your choice.

After confirmation, feedback will be shown with black or white pegs next to the code.
Pegs on the left side of the board show information on your own code, pegs on the right side show information on the code of your opponent.
Black pegs indicate that a colour is on the correct position on the board.
White pegs indicate that a colour is part of the code, but is not yet correctly positioned.
After this guess has been made, your opponent will make a guess.
This will continue until either player correctly guesses the opponents code or if 8 guesses have been made in total.
If no player has guessed the code after 8 turns, the game ends in a loss for both players.
You may end the game early by pressing the "new game" button on the bottom right of the screen.
Furthermore, after the game is over this button can also be pressed to start a new game.
